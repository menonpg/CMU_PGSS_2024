# CMU PGSS 2024 Course Repository
Coursework repository for PGSS 2024, at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Week 01 
*Introduction to R and Python, IDEs and Local Development Evironments equipped with GenAI (Github Copilot, Ollama models)*

## Setup for Development Environment

### 1. Development Environment
- **Local:**
  - Setting up a local development environment on your personal machine.
  - Commonly used IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and tools.

- **Cloud:**
  - Utilizing cloud-based development environments for flexibility and collaboration.
  - Examples include:
    - **Google Colab:** A cloud-based notebook environment that supports Python.
    - **Lightning.ai:** A platform for building and deploying AI models.
    - **Posit.cloud:** A cloud-based environment for R and Python.

### 2. Languages
- **R:** 
  - Commonly used for statistical computing and graphics.
  - Useful in data analysis and machine learning tasks.
- **Python:**
  - Versatile programming language with extensive libraries for data science, machine learning, and AI.
- **Markdown:**
  - A lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.
  - Useful for writing documentation, README files, and notes.

### 3. Code Versioning
- **Git:**
  - A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.
  - Essential for collaboration and managing code versions.
- **GitHub:**
  - A platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
  - Provides version control and project management tools.

### 4. GenAI (Generative AI)
- **Github Copilot:**
  - An AI-powered code completion tool that suggests code snippets based on the context.
- **Local Language Models (LLMs):**
  - Utilizing local instances of language models for various AI tasks.
  - Examples include Ollama, which can be integrated into development workflows.

## Week 02 
*L3 - 7/2/2024: Working with Tabular Data [Regression vs Classification]*

---

#### Datasets to Explore:

1. **UC Irvine ML Datasets Repository:**
   - [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)

2. **Internal Datasets:**
   - **R:**
     ```R
     library(datasets)
     ```
   - **Sklearn Datasets:**
     ```python
     from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
     iris = load_iris()
     ```

---

#### Key Topics:

1. **Building Classification and Regression Models from Tabular Data:**
   - Understand the difference between classification (categorizing data) and regression (predicting continuous values).

2. **Understanding Boxplots:**
   - Learn how to use boxplots to separate categorical classes based on a continuous variable.

3. **Statistical Tests:**
   - Introduction to statistical tests with a focus on the t-test, which compares the means of two groups.

4. **Classification:**
   - Definition and examples of classification problems.
   - Techniques for building classification models.

5. **Regression:**
   - Definition and examples of regression problems.
   - Techniques for building regression models.

6. **Building a Classification Model in R and Python (Logistic Regression):**
   - Steps to create logistic regression models in both R and Python.

7. **Building a Regression Model in R:**
   - Steps to create regression models in R.

8. **Using Notebooks in R and Publishing to RPubs:**
   - How to create and publish R Notebooks to RPubs for public viewing.

9. **Opening .ipynb Files in GitHub Using Colab:**
   - Use the Colab plugin or a custom Readme-specific line of code to open Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) in GitHub.

10. **Building a StreamLit App:**
    - Steps to create a StreamLit app to host a model for web-based interactive inference.
